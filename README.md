# images
this is a program to take observations and sort them by satellite number

The input file has satellite number, date, time, Right Ascension, Declination, and some other numbers that I need to look up
this was started from "observations" which I thought was sorting observations but the other files
were attempts that were not successful

the idea is to sort various days of observations, where various satellites are imaged, and compile
a number of total observations of each satellite

Uses Qsort

The line of each observation is read in and then scanned, the line is read in as a string of characters
Output is not yet correct
